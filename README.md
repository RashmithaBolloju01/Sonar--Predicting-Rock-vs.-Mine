# Sonar – Predicting Rock vs. Mine

Sonar – Predicting Rock vs. Mine is a binary classification project that uses sonar signal data to predict whether an object is a rock or a mine. This project applies machine learning techniques to real-world acoustic data collected from sonar sensors, showcasing the use of supervised learning in defense and geological applications.

# Project Overview

The dataset contains 60 features per instance, each representing the energy of a sonar signal at a specific frequency. The model learns to distinguish between metal mines and naturally occurring rocks based on the frequency response. The project is fully implemented in a Jupyter Notebook using standard machine learning libraries.

# How to Run

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Sonar--Predicting-Rock-vs.-Mine.git
cd Sonar--Predicting-Rock-vs.-Mine
Launch the notebook:
jupyter notebook Sonar_project.ipynb
Run all cells to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate performance.
Make sure required libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib are installed.

# Sample Use Case

This model can be applied in underwater object classification systems, where sonar sensors are used to identify whether an object detected on the seabed is a rock formation or a mine — aiding in autonomous navigation or defense applications.

# Future Enhancements

Implement cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning
Experiment with additional classifiers (e.g., SVM, Random Forest)
Integrate real-time prediction with live sonar input streams
Add an interactive dashboard using Streamlit
