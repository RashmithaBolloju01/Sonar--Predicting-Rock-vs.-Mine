Sonar Predicting Rock vs.Mine

Project Overview

This project leverages a Logistic Regression model to predict whether a sonar signal is indicative of a rock or a mine. The data consists of sonar signals, and the goal is to build a model that can classify them accurately.

Technologies Used

Python 3.x
Libraries:
Pandas: Data manipulation
NumPy: Numerical operations
Scikit-learn: For Logistic Regression and model evaluation
Matplotlib: For visualization (optional)

Dataset

The dataset consists of sonar signals, with each row containing 60 features that represent the signal properties, and a target label of either R (Rock) or M (Mine).

Setup Instructions

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sonar-project.git
cd sonar-project
Install required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the main script to train and test the model:
python sonar_model.py

Steps Followed

Data Preprocessing:
Loaded dataset and split it into features and labels.
Normalized the data for better model performance.
Model Training:
Trained a Logistic Regression classifier on the preprocessed data.
Model Evaluation:
Calculated accuracy, confusion matrix, and other evaluation metrics.

Future Enhancements

Experiment with different machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, SVM).
Hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy.
